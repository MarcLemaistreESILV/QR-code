In this project made with school I had to do a reader and generator of QR code.
In the project we can also find image handling.
We were asked to code one innovation, so I decided to extend the project to every kind of image, regardless of it's size or number of pixels.
This also alowed us to hide code in image that can't be seen by the eye.
